# Renku to Streamlit

A minimal project demonstrating how to set up Streamlit as a default environment
on Renkulab and deploying it to share.streamlit.io through GitHub.

You need to set up a Personal Access Token (with write access) on an empty
GitHub repository which will host a mirror of the repository on Renkulab.

The project can be prototyped by spinning up a new environment in the usual way
at `https://renkulab.io/projects/*namespace*/renku-to-streamlit`.
